# HandGestureControls
Control audio through hand gestures
The code you provided is a Python script for controlling media playback using hand gestures. It uses the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to track hand landmarks and detect the user's gestures. The VLC media player is used to play the media file.

The script works as follows:

It captures a video frame from the webcam.
It converts the video frame to RGB color space.
It detects the hand landmarks in the video frame using the MediaPipe Hands model.
It calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger tips.
If the distance is less than 30 pixels, the script mutes the media player.
If the distance is between 30 and 200 pixels, the script changes the volume of the media player based on the distance.
If the distance is greater than 200 pixels, the script unmutes the media player.
The script also detects the position of the hand relative to two regions of interest (ROIs) on the screen. If the hand is in the ROI for the play/pause controller, the script pauses the media player if it is playing and plays it if it is paused. If the hand is in the ROI for the volume controller, the script changes the volume of the media player based on the position of the hand within the ROI.

The script displays the video frame with the hand landmarks and ROIs drawn on it. It also displays the current volume level and percentage.

To use the script, simply run it in a terminal or command prompt. The script will start playing the media file specified in the media variable. You can then control the media playback using your hand gestures. To quit the script, press the q key.
